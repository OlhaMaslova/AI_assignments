# Linear Regression

## Goal: 
Use gradient descent to build a linear regression model for predicting height (m) using age (yr) and weight (kg), using data derived from CDC growth charts data.

## Completed:
1. Impoerted data
2. Normalized data
3. Implemented gradient descent to predict height
4. Visualized the result of a linear regression model

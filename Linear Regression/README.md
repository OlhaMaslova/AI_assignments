# Linear Regression

## Goal: 
Use gradient descent to build a linear regression model for predicting height (m) using age (yr) and weight (kg), using data derived from CDC growth charts data.

## Completed:
1. Impoerted data
2. Normalized data
3. Implemented gradient descent to predict height
4. Visualized the result of a linear regression model

I tested multiple learning rates in combination with different numbers for epochs and computed Risk function to find the highest alpha that achieves 0.002 in a min number of iterations. Thus, I chose ùõº = 1 because it requires less than 20 iterations to reach R = 0.0023640.

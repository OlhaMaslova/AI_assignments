# Perceptron

## Goal:
Implement the perceptron learning algorithm (PLA) for a linearly separable dataset. Starter code includes data1.csv, where each line contains feature1, feature2, label.

## Completed:
Given a csv of input data and a location to write the output csv with the weights from each iteration, implemented the perceptron algorithm.
